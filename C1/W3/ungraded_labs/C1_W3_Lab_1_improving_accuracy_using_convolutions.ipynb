    "\n",
    "In the model above, your accuracy will probably be about 89% on training and 87% on validation. Not bad. But how do you make that even better? One way is to use something called _convolutions_. We're not going into the details of convolutions in this notebook (please see resources in the classroom), but the ultimate concept is that they narrow down the content of the image to focus on specific parts and this will likely improve the model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever done image processing using a filter (like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing))), then convolutions will look very familiar. In short, you take an array (usually 3x3 or 5x5) and scan it over the entire image. By changing the underlying pixels based on the formula within that matrix, you can do things like edge detection. So, for example, if you look at the above link, you'll see a 3x3 matrix that is defined for edge detection where the middle cell is 8, and all of its neighbors are -1. In this case, for each pixel, you would multiply its value by 8, then subtract the value of each neighbor. Do this for every pixel, and you'll end up with a new image that has the edges enhanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is perfect for computer vision because it often highlights features that distinguish one item from another. Moreover, the amount of information needed is then much less because you'll just train on the highlighted features.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the concept of **Convolutional Neural Networks**. Add some layers to do convolution before you have the dense layers, and then the information going to the dense layers is more focused and possibly more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code below. This is the same neural network as earlier, but this time with [Convolution](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D) and [MaxPooling](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MaxPool2D) layers added first. It will take longer, but look at the impact on the accuracy."

By specifying `(2,2)` for the MaxPooling, the effect is to quarter the size of the image. Without going into too much detail here, the idea is that it creates a 2x2 array of pixels, and picks the biggest one. Thus, it turns 4 pixels into 1. It repeats this across the image, and in doing so, it halves both the number of horizontal and vertical pixels, effectively reducing the image to 25% of the original image.\n",

    "\n",
    "Try running the training for more epochs -- say about 20, and explore the results. But while the results might seem really good, the validation results may actually go down, due to something called _overfitting_. In a nutshell, overfitting occurs when the network learns the data from the training set really well, but it's too specialised to only that data, and as a result is less effective at interpreting other unseen data. For example, if all your life you only saw red shoes, then when you see a red shoe you would be very good at identifying it. But blue suede shoes might confuse you... and you know you should never mess with my blue suede shoes."

The cell below prints the first 100 labels in the test set, and you can see that the ones at index `0`, index `23` and index `28` are all the same value (i.e. `9`). They're all shoes. Let's take a look at the result of running the convolution on each, and you'll begin to see common features between them emerge. Now, when the dense layer is training on that data, it's working with a lot less, and it's perhaps finding a commonality between shoes based on this convolution/pooling combination."
